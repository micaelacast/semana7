    <div class= "p"> <p>The reinterpreted One Star silhouette from Tyler, The Creator and Converse is shown in a trio of colorways; “Jolly Green,” “Solar Power,” and “Vanilla.” The footwear component is also accompanied by two hoodies shown in the gallery above, while a larger “Sherpa” collection including T-shirts, bombers, and hats is also set to drop. While the concept for Golf le FLEUR* originally took root at Tyler’s 2016 Golf Wang fashion show, Converse later jumped on the project as a partner, following Tyler’s departure from Vans. Now we see the project come to life, while the collaboration between Tyler and Converse should continue into 2018. </p> </div>

    <div class= "p"> <p>Characterized by his dope style, Tyler the Creator has created a huge range and variety of snapbacks and baseball caps suiteable for people of all sorts of ages. His selection of pastel colors create the best pop of color for any monochromatic or vividly colorful outfit. His snapbacks aren't very pricey and they also are very durable, creating a signature look for the Odd Future, Golf Wang movement and brand.</p> </div>
